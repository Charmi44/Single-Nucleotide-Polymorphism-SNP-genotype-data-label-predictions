Predicting true labels of 2000+ test labels using sklearn

Classification by linear_model, GaussianNaiveBayes, SVM, NearestCentroid modules are compared to generate model with optimal accuracy 

Pearson Correlation and dimensionality reduction to reduce features 

5-fold cross validation to check stability of the model
